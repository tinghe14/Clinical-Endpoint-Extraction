COMMENT: The Allred score for estrogen and progesterone receptors is calculated by adding the sum of the. proportion score (0 = no staining, 1 = <1% of cells staining, 2 = 1 - 10% of cells staining, 3 = 11-30% of. cells staining, 4 = 31-60% of cells staining, 5 = >60% of cells staining) to the intensity score (1 = weak. intensity of staining, 2 = intermediate intensity of staining, 3 = strong intensity of staining), with a scoring. range from 0 to 8. ER/PR positive is defined as an Allred score of >2 and ER/PR negative is defined as an Allred score. of less than or equal to 2. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the mouse anti-human ER (ER 1D5, 1:100) and PR (PGR. 136, 1:100) provided by Dakc. bllowing the manufacturer s instructions. This. assay was not modified. Interpretation of the ER/PR immunohistochemical stain is guided by published. results in the medical literature, information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal. review of staining performance. SYNOPTIC REPORT - BREAST HER-2 RESULTS. Specimen: Surgical Excision. Block Number: E10. Interpretation: EQUIVOCAL. Intensity: 2+. % Tumor Staining: 15%. Fish Ordered: Yes, on Date. METHODOLOGY: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Her2 analysis was performed using the FDA approved Dako HercepTest (TM) test kit. C. using rabbit anti-human HER2. This assay was not modified. External kit-slides. provided by the manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative HER2 protein expression) and in-. house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along with the test tissue. Adequate, well. preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma was identified for HER2 evaluation. Interpretation of the HER2. immunohistochemical stain is guided by published results in the medical literature, information provided. by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of staining performance. This assay has been validated according to the. int recommendations and guidelines from. ASCO and CAP and from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force. The Pathology. Department takes full responsibility for this test's performance. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit. Analytical Interpretation of Results: HER-2 NOT AMPLIFIED. Clinical Interpretation of results. Amplification of the HER-2 gene was evaluated with interphase fluorescence in-situ. hybridization (FISH) on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections using a chromosome. 17. centromeric probe and a HER-2 probe that spans the entire HER-2 gene in the. by Dr. A majority of tumors cells displayed 2 chromosome 17. signals and 2 HER-2 signals, with a HER-2/CEP 17 Ratio </=2.0, consistent with no. amplification of the HER2/neu gene. Block used E10. Source of case: Tissue fixation. formalin-fixed tissue. Outside Case No: NA. Tissue source. breast Results interpreted: HER2/CEP17 ratio: 1.03. This ratio is derived by dividing the total number of LSI HER-2/neu signals by the total number of. CEP17 signals in at least 20 interphase nuclei with nonoverlapping nuclei in the neoplastic. mammary epithelial cells. Cells with no signals or with signals of only one color are disregarded. Method of ratio enumeration: manual count. Limitations. The Vysis PathVysion Kit is not intended for use to screen for or diagnose breast cancer. It is. intended to be used as an adjunct to other prognostic factors currently used to predict disease-free. and overall survival in stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients. In making decisions regarding. adjuvant CAF treatment, all other available clinical information should also be taken into. consideration, such as tumor size, number of involved lymph nodes, and steroid receptor status. treatment decision for stage II, node-positive breast cancer patients should be based on HER-. 2/neu. gene amplification status alone. Overview of this test. FDA APPROVED REAGENT. PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit is FDA approved for selection of. patients for whom Herceptin therapy is being considered. These tests were performed in the. under the direction. of Dr. The results of these studies should always be interpreted in the context of the. clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic diagnosis.

PATIENT Dot RISULIS. DR. NURSE. Addendum - Please See End of Report. A high percentage of tumor cells (greater than 20%) immunostainino for MGMT has been reported to. be. associated. with a relatively diminished response to Temodar. Hence, the low 5% result in. this case suggests a likelihood of this tumor being responsive to Temodar. Recent studies have shown that co-expression of EGFRvIII and PTEN as detected by immunostaining was. significantly correlated with a clinical response of glioblastomas to EGFR kinase inhibitors. Hence the preserved expression of PTEN in this case, when combined with EGFRvIII. mutation, permits a possibility of this tumor being responsive to EGFR-kinase inhibitors. Retained expression of PTEN was found in be associated with. grade aliomas). n. Molecular subclasses of high-grade glioma. predict prognosis, delineate a pattern of disease progression, and resemble stages in neurogenesis. Cancer Cell,. Recent studies indicated an adverse prognostic significance of increased expression of laminin heta 1 and decreased. expression of laminin beta 2 predicting a worse survival of patients with gliomas. between laminin-8 and glial tumor grade, recurrence, and patient survival. Accordingly, elevated expression of B1 and 32 in this tumor suggest the tumor aggressíveness intermediate between. the Bill (or normal)/22 normal (or ii) (the most favorable prognosis) and Bill/ (least favorable prognosis). Presence of activated (phosphorylated) p42/44 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (pMAPK) has been shown to be. associated with a relative resistance of glioblastoma multiforme to radiation therapy. Prognostic Associations of Activated Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase and Akt Pathways in. Glioblastoma. Clin Cancer Res. Correspondingly, a high percentage of tumor cells immunoreactive to pMAPK antibody in this case predicts a. relative resistance to radiation therapy. The use of these tests in guiding therapy has limitations. Review of the relevant literature and clinical correlation is. advised. These test results do not obligate or preclude use of the relevant therapeutic agents. IDC2a: Selected slides were reviewed in consultation with. HISTORY: Tumor brain.

Senior Staff Pathologist. Procedures/Addenda. PCR for EGFR variant III mutation. Interpretation. POSITIVE - EGFRvIII mutation is detected. Results-Comments. TEST DESCRIPTION: Testing performed on RNA extracted from paraffin tissue block. (A3). H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular target in glioblastoma because it. is amplified,. overexpressed, and/or mutated in up to 40% to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant. III. (EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR that is commonly expressed in. glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRvIII as defining prognostically. distinct. subgroups of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRvIII has been shown to sensitize tumors. to EGFR. tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the tumor suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from. formalin fixed,. paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The cDNA is then amplified using. standard PCR. technique for DNA templates. PCR products are detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of. this assay. has been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal cells.

MGMT Promoter Methylation. Interpretation. NEGATIVE: No evidence of methylated MGMT promoter is detected. Results-Comments. Testing performed on DNA extracted from paraffin tissue block. (A3). H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed. TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter have been shown to. benefit. from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment of MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite. treatment of. DNA followed by real-time PCR amplification. of methylated and unmethylated DNA. sequences. The. analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of methylated positive control DNA into. unmethylated DNA, and was assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated. DNA. Factors. such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the sample, or extensive tissue necrosis, may. preclude the. detection of methylated MGMT promoter sequences. FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand alone diagnostic. test.

TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA (baseline)/ Tumor DNA. pairs using 3. markers at both 1p and 19q. The 3 markers on 1p are D1S548, D1S1592, and D1S552 (with D1S468,. D1S1612, and. D1S496 as backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and PLA2G4C (with. D19S606 and. D19S1182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or 4 nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a. minisatellite (26. nt repeat) polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, amplicon size, and. ease of. interpretation. The backup markers are used if the first line markers at that chromosome arm are. uninformative or. otherwise ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each chromosomal arm. represents the. typical finding in oligodendrogliomas with 1p and 19q deletion.

Architectural features: Uncertain. See Microscopy Description and Comment. Comment. Part A. This specimen is portions of cerebrum that are moderately infiltrated by a glial neoplastic proliferation that. has a. mixed oligo astrocytic phenotype, with uniform round/ovoid nuclei frequently surrounded by halos. However, the. neoplastic cells are devoid of the 1p, 19q deletion characteristic of oligodendrogliomas. Mitotic figures are. found with. great difficulty, and there is not microvascular proliferation or tumor necrosis. The MIB-1 proliferation. index is greater. than 9% (as normal native cells are entered in the total nuclear count; the index is probably no more than. 15%). The findings are interpreted as those of a low histological grade glial neoplasm that has molecular. features of. astrocytoma. The elevated cycling activity may portend a heightened aggressive potential. Part B. This specimen is three small fragments of cerebral cortex in which, because of the small size and. orientation of the. fragments, it is difficult to evaluate the cortical architectural features. Furthermore, the IDH1 stain. demonstrates a. somewhat sparse sprinkling of the cortex by neoplastic glial cells, which interferes even more with. evaluation of the. distribution of normal cells. There is not obvious architectural distortion, dysmorphic neuronal element, or. balloon. cells. The findings are interpreted as a glial neoplasm sparsely infiltrating the cerebral cortex; and non. conclusive of cortical. dysplasia. The features in both specimens may be correlated with clinical, imaging, electrophysiological, and. operative findings. for their interpretation and patient's follow up. Senior Staff Pathologist.

Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block. (A1). DNA extracted from a. corresponding blood specimen was used as a normal reference control. H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed. TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA (baseline)/ Tumor DNA. pairs using 3. markers at both 1p and 19q. The 3 markers on 1p are D1S548, D1S1592, and D1S552 (with D1S468,. D1S1612, and. D1S496 as backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and PLA2G4C (with. D19S606 and. D19S1182 as backup). All markers are microsatellites (2 or 4 nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is. a. minisatellite (26. nt repeat) polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score, amplicon size, and. ease of. interpretation. The backup markers are used if the first line markers at that chromosome arm are. uninformative or. otherwise ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each chromosomal arm. represents the. typical finding in oligodendrogliomas with 1p and 19q deletion. FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand-alone diagnostic. test. This test. was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the. as required. by CLIA 88 regulations. It has not been cleared or approved for specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug. Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These. results are. provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted only in the context of established. procedures. and/or diagnostic criteria. TECHNICAL SENSITIVITY: The presence of >15% non-neoplastic cells in the sample may preclude the. detection of. allelic loss. Senior Staff Pathologist. MGMT Promoter Methylation. Interpretation. LOW POSITIVE: Methylated MGMT promoter is detected. Results-Comments. Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block. (A1). H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed. TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT promoter have been shown to. benefit. from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment of MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite. treatment of. DNA followed by real-time PCR amplification. of methylated and unmethylated DNA. sequences. The. analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by serial dilution of methylated positive control DNA into. unmethylated DNA, and was assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated. DNA. Factors. such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the sample, or extensive tissue necrosis, may. preclude the. detection of methylated MGMT promoter sequences. FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results from a stand alone diagnostic. test. This test. was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the. as required. by CLIA '88 regulations. It has not been cleared or approved for specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug.

Although extensive hyalinization is present. in the tumor bed, this feature was also seen on the pre-treatment biopsy. Hence,. response to chemotherapy is difficult to assess. Of note, no significant. treatment response is seen in the lymph nodes. Specimens Received: A: Left breast modified radical mastectomy. Gross Description: A. The specimen is received in a single container labeled with the patient's. name, medical record number, and additionally identified as, 'left breast. modified radical mastectomy'. Received fresh and placed in formalin is a 1,276.6. gm modified radical mastectomy specimen. The specimen is received oriented with. a suture designating left axillary tail. The specimen measures 26.5 cm from. superior to inferior, 27.5 cm from medial to lateral, and 5 cm from anterior to. posterior. There is an attached 9.5 X 9 x 2.5 cm axillary tail. On the. anterior surface is a 23.5 X 13 cm tan-white ellipse of skin with a 6 x 5 cm. areola and a 1.1 X 1 cm flattened nipple. The nipple-areolar complex reveals no. evidence of ulceration or retraction. The specimen is inked as follows: superior edge - blue;. inferior edge - green;. posterior - black. The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 21 slices to. reveal a firm, bulging, scallop tan-white to pink 8.5 X 6.5 X 4.2 cm mass in. slices 5-13. The mass is 0.7 cm from posterior margin (black) and 0.5 cm from. anterior skin. A biopsy tract filled with gel is present in places 6-7, with. clip present in slice 7. The remainder of the specimen consists of. approximately 5% dense gray-white fibrous breast parenchyma and 95% lobulated. yellow adipose tissue. No additional masses or nodules are grossly identified. Sectioning through the axillary tail reveals multiple tan-brown, rubbery lymph. nodes ranging from 0.6 X 0.4 X 0.4- 2 X 0.9 x 0.5 cm in greatest dimension.

""Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries (AF1-3)"" received is a 280. gram, 10.6 x 6.8 x 5.5 cm partially morcellated uterus. The specimen is. unoriented and contains one portion of the cervix (posterior cervix) which is. detached from the specimen. The endocervical canal (2.5 x 1 cm) is white-tan. and has an herringbone pattern. The endometrial canal (not able to be. measured) has a friable, soft endometrium which begins roughly 2.5 cm from. the. lower uterine segment. Sectioning reveals a 0.6 cm endometrium overlying a 2. cm myometrium. The friable endometrium does not appear to invade the. myometrium. There are multiple (greater than 20) white, whorled lesions in. the myometrium, the largest of which measures 2 x 2 x 1.9 cm. Sectioning. of. these white, whorled lesions does not reveal any hemorrhage or necrosis. The. right tube (partially morcellated) and measures 3 cm in length x 0.6 cm in. diameter and has an unattached fimbriae. Sectioning reveals an unremarkable. tube. The right ovary (2.5 x 1.2 x 1 cm) is white, cerebriform, and is. grossly unremarkable. The left tube is also interrupted but measures 2.5 cm. in length x 0.6 cm in diameter.

Histologically, the enucleated eye demonstrates a normal. anterior segment with an unremarkable cornea, a deep. anterior chamber and open angles. The iris leaves are. unremarkable. The ciliary muscles are moderately atrophic. orinted: HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT. Lab No. Clinical Consultant & Location. Unit No. There is mild hyalinisation of the ciliary processes. The. lens shows moderately advanced cataractous changes. In the posterior segment, at the level of the equator, a. choroidal melanoma can be seen. This is dome-shaped with a. large accompanying exudative retinal detachment. The retina. overlying the tumour is atrophic with degenerative changes,. and focally there is retinal invasion. The tumour is partially pigmented and consists of a mixture. of cells, both epithelioid and spindle cells, with a slight. dominance of the latter. The epithelioid cell component is. approx. 40%. The melanoma cells are immunoreactive for. MelanA, SOX-10 and HSP-27 (score 2). The number of mitoses is approx. 5/40 high power fields. The. microvasculature of the melanoma is prominent, but closed. loops are not present in the tissue planes evaluated. Occasional ""vascular lakes"" can be observed; in these tumour. cells can be see located within the lumen. The lymphocytic. infiltrate within tumour is minimal. Macrophages are. scattered throughout the tumour in moderate density. There is a large extraocular growth, which has arisen at two. sites, transclerally. These are 3mm and 1mm in diameter,. respectively. The larger is encapsulated only by a very thin. layer of connective tissue. The optic nerve is tumour free, and demonstrates mild. atrophic changes. The examined vortex veins are free of. tumour. DIAGNOSIS. Choroidal melanoma of mixed cell type with extraocular. melanoma growth. COMMENT. Molecular genetic examination of DNA extracted from the. tumour cells will be performed using multiplex-ligation. dependent probe amplification (MLPA), looking at chromosomes.",train,15mm;15mm

OPERATIVE DIAGNOSES. Possible brain tumor left temporal lobe. Operation/Specimen: A: Brain tumor, biopsy. PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS: Brain, site not specified, excisional biopsy: Anaplastic. oligodendroglioma. See Microscopy Description and Comment. COMMENT. The sections contain portions of cerebrum that are heavily. infiltrated/effaced. by a neoplastic proliferation of glial cells that have astrocyte-like. phenotype, but with rather uniform round nuclei and frequently with. perinuclear halos. There is brisk mitotic activity, with a high MIB-1. proliferation index of about 30%. There is prominent endothelial. hyperplasia,. and focal microvascular cellular proliferation. There is no tumor. necrosis. The features are those of an anaplastic oligodendroglioma. Results of molecular testing are reported below. PROCEDURES/ADDENDA. PCR for EGFR variant III mutation. Interpretation. NEGATIVE - No evidence of EGFRVIII mutation is detected. Results-Comments. TEST DESCRIPTION: Testing performed on RNA extracted from. H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive molecular. target. in glioblastoma because it is amplified, overexpressed, and/or mutated. in up. to 40% to 50% of patients. Epidermal growth factor receptor variant. III. (EGFRvIII) is an oncogenic, constitutively active mutant form of EGFR. that is. commonly expressed in glioblastoma. Cell culture and in vivo models of. glioblastoma have demonstrated EGFRVIII as defining prognostically. distinct. subgroups of glioblastomas. Additionally, the presence of EGFRVIII has. been. shown to sensitize tumors to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors when the. tumor. suppressor protein PTEN is intact. RNA is extracted from formalin. fixed,. paraffin embedded tissue samples and reverse transcribed to cDNA. The. cDNA is. then amplified using standard PCR technique for DNA templates. PCR. products. are detected by gel electrophoresis. The limit of detection of this. assay has. been determined to be approximately 5 mutant cells in 100 normal. cells. FDA Comment: The above data are not to be construed as the results. from a. stand alone diagnostic test. This test was developed and its. performance. characteristies determined by the. laboratory as. required by CLIA '88 regulations. It has not been cleared or approved. for. specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) The FDA. has. determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.

Interpretation. NEGATIVE: No evidence of methylated MGMT promoter is detected. Results-Comments. Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block. H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed. TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT. promoter. have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment of. MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA. followed. by real-time PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and. unmethylated DNA. sequences. The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by. serial. dilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and. was. assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated. DNA. Factors such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the. sample, or. extensive tissue necrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated. MGMT. promoter sequences. FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results. from a. stand alone diagnostic test. This test was developed and its. performance. characteristics determined by the. laboratory as. required by CLIA '88 regulations.

Loss of Heterozygosity 1p, 19q Assay (LOH). Interpretation. POSITIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 1p is detected. Loss of one allele noted in one marker on chromosome arm 19q. suggestive of. partial deletion (D19S1182). Informative loci are: D1S1592, D1S1612, D1S552, D19S219, D19S606 and. D19S1182. Results-Comments -. Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block. DNA extracted from a corresponding blood specimen was used as a normal. reference control. H and E slide was examined and no microdissection was needed. TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA. (baseline), / Tumor DNA pairs using 3 markers at both 1p and 19q. The 3. markers. on 1p are D1S548, D1S1592, and D1S552 (with D1S468, D1S1612, and. D1S496 as. backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and. PLA2G4C. (with D19S606 and D19S1182 as backup) All markers are microsatellites. (2 or 4. nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat). polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score,. amplicon size, and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used. if the. first line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or. otherwise. ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each. chromosomal arm represents the typical finding in oligodendrogliomas. with 1p. and 19q deletion.

COMMENT: MGMT GENE AMPLIFICATION. DNA was isolated from a paraffin embedded block of the brain tumor biopsy. DNA methylation patterns in the CpG island of the MGMT gene. ) was determined by chemical. (bisulfite) modification of unmethylated, but not methylated, cytosines to. uracil and subsequent PCR using primers specific for either methylated or the. modified unmethylated DNA. The. PCR products were analyzed in duplicate parallel runs by capillary gel. electrophoresis. The sensitivity of the assay based on DNA dilution studies. is at least 1:1000. The analyzed region of the MGMT promoter is UNMETHYLATED. INTERPRETATION: MGMT (06 methylguaine DNA methyltransferase) is a DNA repair gene. Methylation. of the promotor leads to gene silencing and loss of MGMT expression. a recent. study that tested the methylation status of the same region of the MGMT. promoter in glioblastomas found that MGMT promoter methylation was an. independent favorable prognostic factor and was associated with a survival. benefit in patients treated with temozolamide and radiotherapy. e.

Additional margin: The distal end of Part A (right ureter) is involved by. high grade invasive carcinoma (slide A3) into the. muscularis propria; however the proximal specimen margin (slide A1). demonstrates chronic inflammation of the lamina propria with. atypia of the urothelial mucosa with we regard as reactive atypia. In Part D. (labeled final proximal margin of the right. ureter) the proximal specimen margin (slide D1) is negative for dysplasia or. carcinoma. However the distal end of this specimen. (slide D4) reveals nuclear atypia of urothelial carcinoma in situ. Because of. the intense chronic inflammation, distinguishing. reactive vs dysplastic changes are difficult. Immunohistochemical stain for. p53 was performed on slide D3 where the inflamed. urothelium have atypical, round, slightly enlarged nuclei and prominent. nucleoli. The stains highlights scattered positivity. Thus based on the morphology and results of the immunohistochemical stain, the. atypical changes on slide D3 are regarded as. reactive.

Microscopic (small. vessel) invasion is absent. No regional lymph nodes are identified. The surrounding non-neoplastic hepatic parenchyma shows no. significant diagnostic abnormality (see comment). Pathologic staging based on available surgical pathology material. (AJCC 7th edition) : pT3a. Comment: The sections of the large mass present in segments II and. III (part A) demonstrate a well differentiated neoplasm with bland. cytology that shows loss of the normal reticulin network and. dispersion of the neoplastic cells by an intercellular material. suggestive of mucin. The reticulin network is preserved in the. surrounding liver parenchyma. A glypican 3 stain is negative in the. neoplastic cells and is noncontributory. The separately submitted. wedge resections from segment VI, segment VIII, and segment IVB show. smaller nodules with similar histologic features. No defined lesion. is identified in the liver segment VII. The overall features including loss of the reticulin network and the. multifocality suggest, although the cytologic features are bland and. well differentiated, that this represents a well differentiated. hepatocellular carcinoma.

In. the gray matter, there is prominent perineuronal satellitosis as well as subpial surface spread. Tumor cells have round nuclei with few apparent cytoplasmic processes. Many demonstrate. perinuclear halos. There is little cytologic atypia. No mitotic figures are seen. There is no. microvascular proliferation or necrosis. Addendum discussion: Numerous MIB-1 reactive cells are present throughout the specimen. A labeling index of 21% is. calculated. This is indicative of a markedly proliferative glial neoplasm. Despite this, no mitotic. figures are identified on the. stain and only a rare mitotic figure was indentified on the. immunohistochemistry. Consequently, the tumor must be classified as low grade/grade II. Nevertheless, the very high MIB-1 labeling index suggests more aggressive behavior. Close. clinical follow-up is indicated.

DNA was isolated from a paraffin embedded block of the brain tumor. biopsy. DNA methylation patterns in the CpG island of the. MGMT gene. was determined. by chemical. (bisulfite) modification of unmethylated, but not methylated,. cytosines to. uracil and subsequent PCR using primers specific for either. methylated or the. modified unmethylated DNA. The. PCR products were analyzed in duplicate parallel runs by capillary. gel. electrophoresis. The sensitivity of the assay based on DNA. dilution studies. is at least 1:1000. The analyzed region of the MGMT promoter is UNMETHYLATED. INTERPRETATION: MGMT (06 methylguaine DNA nethyltransferase) is a DNA repair gene. Methylation. of the promotor leads to gene silencing and loss of MGMT. expression. a recent. study that tested the methylation status of the same region of the. MGMT. promoter in glioblastomas found that MGMT promoter methylation was. an. independent favorable prognostic factor and was associated with a. survival. benefit in patients treated with temozolamide and radiotherapy. and Benefit from.

RIGHT FRONTAL BRAIN LESION, RESECTION: - GLIOBLASTOMA WITH OLIGODENDROGLIOMA COMPONENT, WHO GRADE IV. - SEE COMMENT. COMMENT: This glioblastoma has an element of oligodendroglioma within it,. comprising. approximately 20% of neoplastic cells. Perhaps more. morphologically. impressive is the high degree of angiogenesis and the extensive. reactive. stromal component associated with it. In the majority of this. stromal. reaction, the matrix has a myxoid appearance whereas in others of. the stroma. has a more highly spindled and collagen-rich. These stromal. elements are. interpreted as a reactive process associated with the angiogenesis. because of. the geographic association of these two processes.

TUBULAR ATROPHY AND INTERSTITIAL FIBROSIS, MILD (10-15% OF CORTEX). - ARTERIAL AND ARTERIOLAR SCLEROSIS, MODERATE. (SEE NOTE). PAPILLARY ADENOMA (0.1 cm). NOTE: Mild chronic changes are present in the kidney parenchyma, not including the. loss of nephrons from cyst and tumor-related compression. Because these. changes are a result of functional adaptations to nephron loss from any. glomerular, tubular, interstitial, vascular, or mass-replacing process, a. similar degree of chronic damage would be expected in the contralateral kidney. Incidental note is made of a papillary adenoma. The kidney parenchyma has been reviewed by. Renal Pathology. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (block A6) were evaluated. using HE, PAS, Jones silver methenamine, and AFOG (trichrome) stains. The sample consists of cortex and medulla. There are 157 glomeruli present. away from the cyst wall, of which 12 are globally sclerosed and 2 are. segmentally sclerosed. Extensive glomerulosclerosis is present adjacent to the. cyst wall; the parenchyma in this area also shows compression-related changes. and entrapped tubules, vessels with smooth muscle hypertrophy, and glomeruli. The remaining glomeruli show no significant expansion of the mesangial areas. There are no discernible craters or spikes, but a few double contours of the. glomerular capillary wall basement membranes are seen. Approximately 10-15% of. the cortical parenchyma shows tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis. Arteries and arterioles exhibit a moderate degree of sclerosis. GROSS DESCRIPTION.

Gross Description: 1) The specimen is received fresh labeled ""rectum and rectosigmoid"". It. consists of a rectosigmoid colon that measures 12.0 cm in length by 7.0 cm. in circumference at the distal resection margin. The serosal surface is pink. and smooth. The radial resection margin is inked black and the specimen is. opened to reveal a pink-tan papillary tumor measuring 2.9 cm in length by. 1.8 cm in width by 0.4 cm, located 3.5 cm from the distal resection margin. There is a smooth sessile polyp measuring 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm, located 0.7 cm. from the tumor, and 5.0 cm from the closest (distal) resection margin. There. is a second pink-tan smooth sessile polyp measuring 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm,. located 1.2 cm from the tumor, and 3.2 cm from the distal resection margin. (arbitrarily designated P2) There is a third pink-tan smooth sessile polyp. measuring 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm, 1.0 cm distal to the tumor, and 1.8 cm from. the distal resection margin (arbitrarily designated P3) . The three polyps. are blocked out and entirely submitted. The tumor is sectioned to reveal a. well defined pink-white extension to depth of 0.8 cm grossly not involving. the underlying fat, and 1.2 cm from the inked radial resection margin. Representative sections of the tumor are submitted. Remaining mucosa is. otherwise grossly unremarkable. The specimen is submitted for lymph nodes. and possible lymph nodes are submitted. TPS is taken. Representative. sections are submitted. Summary of sections: PM - proximal margin. DM distal margin. RM -- radial margin. T-- tumor. P1, P2, P3polyps submitted from proximal to distal.

It consists of a kidney with surrounding. perinephric fat weighing a total of 844 grams and measuring 22 x 16 X 8.5. cm. The attached ureter measures 9.5 cm in length and 0.3 cm in. diameter. The ureter is opened to show a smooth tan-pink mucosa with no. papillary structures noted. The specimen is bisected to show a 10.5 X 6.5. x 4 cm kidney. A well-demarcated, golden-yellow firm 3.5 x 3 x 3 cm. nodule is identified at the superior pole and comes within less than 0.1. cm of the renal capsule. Grossly the tumor appears confined to the kidney. and does not appear to infiltrate the surrounding perinephric fat. The. remaining renal parenchyma is tan-pink, soft with no other discrete masses. present. The attached adrenal measures 4.5 x 2.5 x 2 cm.

Two additional cells had nonclonal changes. One metaphase contained an. extra copy of chromosome 14. Another metaphase was a broken tetraploid. cell. RESULTS: The renal mass was harvested after twelve and fourteen days in. culture. The chromosomes from twenty metaphases were counted and. analyzed, and four of these metaphases were karyotyped by G-banding. Eighteen cells had a modal chromosome number of 46 and appeared to have a. normal karyotype. Two cells had nonclonal changes. One of these. metaphases contained an extra copy of chromosome 14. Another metaphase. was a broken tetraploid cell. The significance of a single abnormal cell. is unclear.

COMMENT: A high percentage of tumor cells (greater than 20%) immunostaining for MGMT has been reported to be associated. with a relatively diminished response to Temodar. Hence, the low 5% result in. this case suggests a likelihood of this tumor being responsive to Temodar. Recent studies have shown that co-expression of EGFRvIII and PTEN as detected by immunostaining was. significantly correlated with a clinical response of glioblastomas to EGFR kinase inhibitors. Hence the loss of PTEN in this case suggests a diminished probability of response to. EGFR-kinase inhibitors. Patient Case(s): Page UI ,. PATIENT NOTIFIED OF RESULTS. DR: NURSE: Addendum - Please See End of Report. Recent studies indicated an adverse prognostic significance of increased expression of laminin beta 1 and decreased. expression of laminin beta 2 predicting a worse survival of patients with gliomas. between laminin-8 and glial tumor grade, recurrence, and patient survival. Accordingly, elevated expression of beta 1 and suppressed expression of beta 2 in this tumor predict more. aggressive behavior. Retained expression of PTEN was found to be associated with a more favorable prognosis in patients with high. grade gliomas. Molecular subclasses of high-grade glioma. predict prognosis, delineate a pattern of disease progression, and resemble stages in neurogenesis. Cancer Cell. Presence of activated (phosphorylated p42/44 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (pMAPK) has been shown to be. associated with a relative resistance of glioblastoma multiforme to radiation therapy. Prognostic Associations of Activated Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase and Akt Pathways in. Glioblastoma. Correspondingly, presence of a large fraction of cells immunonegative to pMAPK antibody in this case suggests a. likelihood of this tumor being responsive to radiation therapy. The use of these tests in guiding therapy has limitations. Review of the relevant literature and clinical correlation. is. advised. These test results do not obligate or preclude use of the relevant therapeutic agents. IDC2a: Selected slides were reviewed in consultation with. HISTORY: Temporal tumor.

GROSS DESCRIPTION. A) Received fresh, labeled. and designated ""left near-. total glossectomy and partiar pharyngectomy Tert neck dissection zones 1, 2, 3"" ,. is a glossectomy, pharyngectomy, neck dissection specimen. The tongue is 9.5 cm. anterior to posterior, 4.5 cm left to right and 3.4 cm superior to inferior. The. pharyngectomy specimen is 6.8 cm anterior to posterior, 3.0 cm left to right and. 3.9 cm superior to inferior. The neck dissection is 8.0 x 6.1 x 3.4 cm. The. specimen is oriented per the specimen container as follows: Single stitch superior tonsil margin, double long stitch left vallecula, double. short stitch neck dissection zone 3. There is another single stitch that is. oriented in person by a member of the surgical team as a prominent lymph node in. zone 1A on the left side. The specimen is inked as follows: Right side of tongue margin = red. Base of tongue margin = blue. Inferior portion of tongue margin = black. Vallecula margin = orange. Posterolateral oropharynx margin = green. Superior tonsillar margin = yellow. Floor of mouth margin = orange. Lateral oropharynx margin = black. Gross photographs are taken. The neck dissection tissue is removed and the resultant exposed tissue is inked. yellow. The tongue, left floor of mouth and left oropharynx contain a large. ulcerated mass with deep furrows and papillary structures. This irregular. ulcerated mass measures 7 x 4.5 cm. The ulcerations extend 1.8 cm into the. tongue from the surface.

GROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received in two containers labeled with the patient's name . A. Container A is received fresh for frozen section, additionally labeled 'right sentinel node' and contains a 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm aggregate of yellow-tan. fibrofatty soft tissue. On palpation, a 1.3 cm firm fatty nodule is identified consistent with possible lymph node. The nodule is bisected and entirely. submitted for frozen section. The residual is entirely resubmitted for permanent section in cassette A labeled. B. Container B is received with formalin additionally labeled 'right breast tissue' and consists of a 1439.4 gram, 27.5 x 19.0 x 6.5 cm simple mastectomy. specimen partially surfaced by pink-tan wrinkled skin which bears a central 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.2 cm slightly raised nipple. Orientation is not offered or possible. Located 0.7 cm from the skin edge and 7.8 cm from the nipple is a 1.3 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm gray-brown raised skin lesion. Additional skin lesions are not. identified. The deep margin is inked and the specimen is serially sectioned to reveal a 2.8: x 1.5 x 1.0 cm cystic lesion containing pink-tan friable soft. tissue, along with a radiographic clip. This lesion resides 4.5 cm from the skin surface and 2.2 cm from the inked deep margin. Multiple additional pink-. tan rubbery lesions are identified diffusely scattered throughout the specimen and involve all four quadrants. The largest of these remaining lesions is. 3.0 x 1.8 x 1.8 cm and approaches to within 0.4 cm of the inked deep margin. The uninvolved areas are comprised of yellow-tan adipose tissue admixed. with moderate amounts of interspersed gray-white fibrous tissue. Discrete axillary tail is not present, however, five firm fatty possible lymph nodes are. identified along one edge of the specimen. These possible lymph nodes range from 1.0 up to 1.4 cm in greatest dimension. Also received in the same container are two portions of pink-tan wrinkled skin with yellow-tan subcutaneous fibroadipose tissue. These tissues are 8.0 x. 2.0 x 1.3 cm and 16.0 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm.The cut surfaces are yellow-tan fibrofattywith no discrete lesions. Representative sections are submitted in. cassettes B1 through 13 labeled. esignated as follows: 1, nipple; 2, skin lesion, entirely; 3 and 4, radiographically located lesion; 5 and 6,. largest additional lesion to inked usep margin, perpendicular; 7 through 10, additional representative lesions from all four quadrants; 11, two whole. possible lymph nodes; 12, two whole possible bisected lymph nodes (one inked): 13. one whole possible bisected lymph node.

RIGHT BRAIN TUMOR: Glioblastoma, WHO grade IV/IV, with the following features: -Degree of cellularity: High. -Microvascular proliferation: present. -Necrosis: present. Mitotic activity: high, at least 20 per 10 high power fields. Other features: MGMT studies (PCR and immunohistochemistry) and FISH. studies are pending. -Please see comment section. B. CYST ASPIRATE (including evaluation of cellblock): -Proteinaceous fluid. D. CONNECTIVE DURA: -Fibrous connective tissue consistent with dura showing infiltrating. glioblastoma. COMMENT: In addition to the usual features of glioblastoma, there is a region of small. clustered cells in part E reminiscent of neuronal or primitive. neuroectodermal differentiation. Immunostains reveal delicate synaptophysin. positivity and decreased GFAP expression compared to the opposite findings. in. the high-grade glial component. These changes are supportive of focal. primitive neuronal differentiation. P53 immunostains show staining in both. components. In part D, the glioblastoma invades the apparent dura. Foci suggestive of. vascular invasion by tumor were raised and immunostains to GFAP and CD31. applied to further characterize the tumor. The tumor is GFAP positive and the. dura is richly vascular. The suspected areas are not represented in the. sections studied, however, and the question of vascular invasion cannot be. confirmed.

METHODOLOGY. Methodology: Fixation Type and Length: Tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. ) for no less than 8 and no longer than 24 hours. Antibody and Assay Methodology: Rabbit anti-human HER2, HerceptestTM (FDA-approved test kit),. Control. Slides Examined: External kit-slides provided by manufacturer (cell lines with high, low and negative. HER2 protein expression), and in-house known HER2 amplified control tissue were evaluated along. with the test tissue. These control slides run along side of this patient's sample showed appropriate. staining. Adequacy of Specimen: Adequate, well preserved, clear-cut invasive carcinoma identified for. HER2 evaluation. Scoring Criterion and Scoring System: IHC Level of Expression(Score) /Tumor Cell Membrane Staining Pattern. Negative (0)/Absence of Staining. Negative (1+)/Faint Incomplete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells. Equivocal (2+)/Weak complete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells. Positive (3+)/Strong complete membrane Staining, >10% of Cells. Equivocal Category for HER2 IHC results: A HER2, 2+ staining result that is interpreted as equivocal. may not indicate gene amplification. A FISH test for HER2 gene amplification will be ordered for all. HER2 IHC 2+ results. COMMENT. HER2 analysis was performed on this case by immunohistochemistry utilizing the FDA approved. HercepTest (TM) test kit following the manufacturer's instructions listed in the package insert. This. assay was not modified, and adherence to all instruction and guidelines were strictly followed. Interpretation of the HER2 immunohistochemical staining characteristics is guided by published results. in the medical literature (4), information provided by the reagent manufacturer and by internal review of. staining performance within Pathology Department. HER2 TEST VALIDATION. This HER2 immunohistochemical assay has been validated according to the recently revised. recommendations and guidelines from the NCCN HER2 testing in Breast Cancer Task Force, and the. jointly issued recommendations and guidelines from ASCO and the CAP (5). 80 randomly selected. breast cancer samples were tested for HER2 by IHC as outline above and interpreted as, negative. (score 0/1+) equivocal (score 2+) and positive (score 3+) without knowledge of the previous reported. results. These cases were also blindly read using two different FISH assay as amplified or non-amplified and. the HER2/CEP17 ratios were recorded. After analyzing these results, there was 100% concordance. between the IHC and FISH results for cases that were interpreted as either positive or negative by IHC. 9 of the 80 cases were interpreted as equivocal by IHC and of these 3/9 (33%) were non-amplified by. FISH and 6/9 (66%) were found to be amplified. The Pathology Department Immunohistochemistry laboratory takes full responsibility for this tests. performance and has programs in place to regularly monitor the proficiency and the interpretation of. HER2 assays. The laboratory also participates in external quality assurance HER2 programs including. the CAP proficiency testing program. REFERENCE. 1.

8831,TCGA-ZH-A8Y1.B4025F42-46CB-4D4E-ABB4-DBF701615F14,"Diagnosis: A: Liver lesion, ""Level 5"", excision. - Adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated, of intrahepatic. bile ducts (primary hepatic cholangiocarcinoma), 4.5 mm. - Carcinoma is less than 1 mm from inked parenchymal margin. - Dysplasia of the intraductal biliary epithelium (see comment). B: Liver, Segment 8, excision. - Adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated, of intrahepatic. bile ducts (primary hepatic cholangiocarcinoma), at least two. separate foci by gross examination, 0.4 and 0.8 cm. - Inked parenchymal margin (definitive margin) positive for. carcinoma (B2). - Dysplasia of the intraductal biliary epithelium and. intraductal biliary papillary carcinoma in situ, mutlifocal. C: Liver, Segments 2-5, partial hepatectomy. Adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated, of intrahepatic. bile ducts (primary hepatic cholangiocarcinoma), at least 11.2. cm by gross measurement. - Dysplasia of the intraductal biliary epithelium and. intraductal biliary papillary carcinoma in situ, mutlifocal. - Inked parenchymal margin is extensively positive for invasive. carcinoma (C1). - Bile duct margin is positive for dysplasia (C9). Invasive carcinoma extends into perihepatic fibroadipose. tissue. - Lymphovascular space invasion is identified. - AJCC stage: pT3 pN1 (see comment). D: Lymph nodes, perihepatic, excision. - One of eleven lymph nodes positive for metastatic. adenocarcinoma (1/11). - Size of metastasis is 0.6 cm. - Extracapsular extension identified. Comment: The liver displays a spectrum of intraductal biliary neoplasia. In some bile duct profiles the epithelium is dysplastic without. papillary structure formation. In other bile duct profiles,. intraductal biliary papillomatosis is present as multifocal. papillary lesions. Intraductal papillary carcinoma is. considered to be to be the in situ lesion for the invasive. cholangiocarcinoma, and is related to the pancreatic intraductal. mucinous neoplasm. Dysplasia of the bile duct epithelium without. papillomatosis most likely is part of the same neoplastic. process in this case. The invasive tumor does not have papillary. architecture, and is a conventional gland-forming. adenocarcinoma. Invasive carcinoma is present as large mass. lesions/nodules (mass forming subtype). Extensive peri-ductal invasion (carcinoma spread along intact. biliary tree) is not identified. The tumor is staged as a. pathologic T3 because of invasion into perihepatic fibroadipose. tissue at the round ligament.

Clinical History/Operative Dx: Left renal mass. Gross Description: A. The specimen is labeled left kidney and is received without fixative. It consists of a nephrectomy. specimen which together with perinephric fat weighs 865.0 grams. The specimen measures 19.5 cm from. superior to inferior, 11.0 cm from medial to lateral and 8.5 cm from anterior to posterior. Along the. medial superior edge of the perinephric fat there is a 4.8 x 2.0 x 0.7 cm portion of adrenal gland. On. sectioning the adrenal gland is partially autolyzed and there is a very small 0.2 cm focus of pale tan. discoloration of the adrenal cortical tissue centrally. The anterior surface as well as the superior portion of. the kidney Is bulging and distorted. Over the anterior surface there is a 10.0 x 8.5 cm portion of thin. delicate membranous tissue consistent with Gerota's fascia. Gerota's fascia is inked black. At the hilum. the renal artery and renal vein are identified. The vesseis are opened and there is no gross evidence of. intraluminal tumor. Extending from the hilum is a thin and delicate portion of ureter which is 7.0 cm in. length and has a maximum diameter of 0.3 cm. The ureter is opened and the urothellum is tan-white,. smooth and unremarkable. The kidney is bivalved to reveal an upper pole tumor mass which at its. periphery is translucent and tan-white, centrally dull yellow-tan and possibly infarcted. The tumor mass. measures 11.5 x 9.5 x 7.5 cm. With gentle manipulation, the tumor mass appears to attach itself to the. renal capsule at the superior pole and does not, except for a small focus, appear to be attached to the. cortical surface of the kidney. Serial sections of the tumor reveal It Is in the perinephric fat and abuts. Gerota's fascia along the anterior surface. Tumor approaches to within 0.4 cm of the adrenal gland. Tumor is present at the perirenal fat at the hilum. The uninvolved kidney shows fatty infiltration of the. hilum and a well delineated cortical medullary junction. The cortical thickness is 0.6 cm. No other renal. parenchymal masses are identified. Dissection of the perinephric fat reveais no obvious lymph nodes. Representative sections are submitted.

The immunostaining is done. using DAKO rabbit anti--human CEA which is ""the purified immunoglobulin. fraction of rabbit antiserum (DAKO product A115) The histological sections of. ovary contains abundant adenocarcinoma for evaluation. The tumor cells stain. focally for carcinoembryonic antigen. The cells that stain positively are. scattered throughout the tumor, and I estimate that the positively staining. cells comprise only 1 to 2% of the population. The positively staining cells. exhibit mildly intense staining. There are focal areas within the tumor where. there is a greater percentage of cells which stain positively (approximately. 1/3 of the tumor cells are positive), but this is compensated for by other. areas in which none of the tumor cells stain positively. Overall, there is. insignificant expression of CEA by the tumor. The histological sections from the omentum also contain abundant tumor.

It consists of a complete larynx with attached tongue base, superior trachea and surrounding. soft tissue having an overall measurement of 8.5 x 5.5 X 5.0 cm. The mucosal surface of the epiglottis shows a peripherally. fungating, centrally ulcerating mass lesion that measures 3.5 x 2.8 cm. The lesion Is centered approximately 0.5 cm to the left of. the midline and 3.1 cm from the tlp of the epiglottis. The mass extends inferlorly, apparently involving the left false vocal chord,. obscuring the left ventricle and abutting the superior surface of the left true chord. On the right, the mass appears to extend to the. superior aspect of the false chord, compressing the right ventricle. The right true chord is edematous and expanded. Serial. sections along the mid-sagiltal plane at 3 mm intervals show the mass extending Into the pre-epiglottic space (predominantly on. the left), with extension between the hyoid bone and superlor aspect of the thyrold cartilage. Maximum thickness of the leslon is. approximately 2.0 cm. The lesion appears to invade into the base of the tongue, but remains at least 0.5 cm from the tongue base. margin. The lesion directly abuts the epiglottic cartilage In multiple areas but does not appear to Invade it. At the tip of the. epiglottis is an irregularly shaped area of ulceratlon that measures 0,8 X 0.6 cm, and 1-2 mm in depth. The mucosa overlying the. left pre-epiglottic reglon shows a deep, well-demarcated ulceration that measures 1.0 x 0.6 cm, with a depth of 3 mm. On. sectioning, this ulceration Is contiguous with the invading mass lesion in the underlying pre-epiglottic space. The tracheal mucosa. is glistening, tan, and shows multifocal pinpoint hemorrhage.

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received in six parts, each labeled with the. patient's name. 1. Part one is received in saline, labeled 'level 9 lymph node'. It. consists of two irregular fragments of tan soft tissue measuring 0.8. X 0.5 X 0.2 cm and 0.6 X 0.4 X 0.2 cm. Entirely submitted in one. cassette. 2. Part two is received fresh, labeled 'right upper lobectomy'. It. consists of a portion of right upper lobe of lung, measuring 15.6 X. 3.8 cm. The staple line measures 15.5 cm. The staple line is shaved. and the pleura around the staple line is inked in green. The pleural. surface is pink tan glistening and reveals a thickened, bossellated. area with fibrous thickening. The bronchial margin measures 1.5 cm. and the vascular margin 1.2 cm. Beneath the thickened pleura there. is a firm gray area, measuring 1.5 X 1.5 X 1.0 cm, located 4.5 cm. from the staple line margin. Also noted a second separate firm gray. white area, measuring 1.5 cm in greatest dimension which upon. pressure exudes cheesy material. This mass is located 1 cm from the. staple line margin, also multiple anthracotic lymph nodes, ranging. from 0.2 cm to 0.5 cm identified from the hilar area. Representative. sections are submitted. 3. Part three is received in saline, labeled 'level 7 lymph node'. It consists of three irregular fragments of tan soft tissue. measuring 1.5 X 0.7 X 0.3 cm, 1.5 x 1 X 0.2 cm and 0.5 X 0.5 X 0.2. cm. Entirely submitted in two cassettes. 4. Part four is received in saline, labeled 'level 4 lymph node'. It consists of a 0.7 X 0.4 x 0.1 cm irregular portion of tan soft. tissue. Entirely submitted in one cassette. 5. Part five is received in saline, labeled 'additional right upper. lobe margin'. It consists of a 6.5 X 4.5 X 2.5 cm triangular-shaped. wedge of lung tissue, with a 6.5 cm long stapled line along one. edge, and two stapled lines along an adjacent edge measuring 3 cm. and 4 cm respectively. The specimen is photographed. The 6.5 cm. long stapled edge is inked black; the 3 cm long stapled edge. (adjacent to the 6.5cm long one) is inked blue; and the 4 cm long. stapled edge is inked green. The black and blue inked stapled lines. are at acute angles. The staples are trimmed off and the specimen. is serially sectioned, revealing no focal lesions or masses. Representative sections are submitted. 6. Part six is received in formalin, labeled 'rib'. It consists of. a 1.4 X 1.4 X 0.6 cm segment of rib with red marrow. Entire. specimen is submitted in one cassette, after decalcification. SUMMARY OF SECTIONS: 1A entirely submitted. 2A vascular margin. 2B bronchial margin. 2C-2J firm area. 2K staple line margin. 2L-2M second mass close to the staple line margin. 2N anthracotic lymph nodes. 3A-3B entirely submitted. 4A entirely submitted. 5A-5E representative sections. 6A rib, after decalcification. SPECIAL PROCEDURES: Decalcification, AFB, GMS, Chromogranin, TTF1. RESULTS: Positive for a p.G12C (c.34G>T) mutation in codon 12 of. the KRAS gene. INTERPRETATION: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to. correlate with poor prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase. inhibitor therapies in patients with non-small lung cancer. COMMENT: KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking. history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and. codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin. embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been. established in samples of colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung. carcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other. tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of. pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.). METHOD/LIMITATION: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample.

Final Diagnosis performed by. ADDENDUM #1: EGFR Mutation Analysis. Genzyme Specimen #. Body Site: Lung. Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: No mutation detected. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified; however 18-20% of. patients with non-small-cell lung cancer and without identifiable. mutations are reported to be responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase. inhibitor therapies. COMMENT: This assay analyzes exons 18-21 of the EGFR tyrosine. kinase domain; based on the current literature, the vast majority of. mutations are expected to occur in these exons. The analytical. sensitivity of the assay is 10-20%, thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. Most data published to date pertain to gefitinib. Similar data have been seen in studies using erlotinib (Tarceva(r)). This test is validated for non-small cell lung carcinoma. The. clinical significance and utility of this test in other tumor types. is unknown. METHOD/LIMITATION: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis.

In some areas, especially the cyst. wall, the cells are associated with prominent microcystic change. Tumor cells have moderately. pleomorphic astrocytic nuclei, some naked and others with gemistocytic cytoplasm; other areas have a. more round, monotonous pattern suggestive of an oligodendroglioma component. Immunostain for p53 is. diffusely positive, however, arguing against an oligodendroglioma. Perineuronal satellitosis is seen. No. evidence of an underlying grade 1 tumor is seen (i.e. no EGBs, Rosethal fibers or noninfiltrative areas). No mitoses are present. Though the cellularity and pleomorphism are in some areas pronounced, no. mitoses, vascular endothelial proliferation or necrosis are present. Immunostain for MIB-1 (slide C3). shows a nuclear labeling rate of up to 6% (rates of greater than 3% are considered likely to represent. anaplastic change by Burger et al., Surgical Pathology of the Nervous System and its Coverings, 4th. ed.).

Test Performed. MGMT Methylation Assay. Specimen Type. Paraffin Block. Gene Methylation DETECTED. Methylation of the MGMT (O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) gene was detected using methylation specific PCR technologies. Methylation Score: 5.67. unmethylated <2.00. methylated >=2.00. Background. MGMT (O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) is a DNA repair enzyme that is involved in the repair of damage caused by a variety of. DNA crosslinking compounds, including alkylating agents. Increased methylation of the MGMT gene promoter region causes diminished or. silenced expression of the gene, making cells more sensitive to DNA damage. This relationship has been shown for glioblastomas and. alkylating agents such as Temodar(R)(temozolomide). Approximately 40% to 45% of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumors exhibit MGMT gene methylation. Retrospective studies have shown that. detection of MGMT promoter methylation in tumor samples is associated with an increased likelihood of a favorable response to temozolomide. Methodology. DNA is isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimen. Molecular analysis of the MGMT gene is performed by methylation-. specific PCR and detected on ABI7900. The MGMT and beta-Actin copy numbers will be used to calculate the ratio of MGMT/beta-Actin. x1000. Molecular-based testing is highly accurate, but as in any laboratory test, rare diagnostic errors may occur. Results of this test are for Investigational Purposes Only. The performance characteristic of this assay have been determined by. The. result should not be used as a diagnostic procedure without confirmation of the diagnosis by another medically established diagnostic product. or procedure. Comments. Block ID: Reference. 1.

The largest portion is sectioned and. submitted labeled A-E while the smaller portion is entirely. submitted labeled F. Microscopic Description: Sections of specimen #2 show a large cell malignant neoplasm that in. areas shows prominent gland formation. These glandular area blend. into more solid nests of neoplastic cells. These are supported by a. dense fibrous stroma and alternate with areas of necrosis. The. neoplasm extends into the pleural but not onto the pleural surface. Sections of the neoplasm within the right upper lobe specimen #3. show a large cell malignant neoplasm with a distinctly different. growth pattern. In this neoplasm the cells form sheets that have. irregular borders. The cells have a moderate amount of eosinophilic. cytoplasm and enlarged pleomorphic nuclei. Sections of the lymph node specimens show no areas of metastatic. carcinoma. Immunohistochemical stains are performed on the neoplasm in the. right lower lobe specimen and right upper lobe specimen. The right. lower lobe specimen shows the neoplasm to be positive for CK7 and. negative for CK20. Some of the cells are strongly positive for. TTF1. These are in the more glandular areas. The more solid areas. are negative for this marker. The more solid areas do express. positivity for CDX-2 where the glandular areas tend to be negative. for this marker. The cells are negative for p63. This staining. pattern would support this being an adenocarcinoma of pulmonary. origin. It is unclear why some of the cells mark with the. colorectal marker CDX-2. This same panel performed on the right. upper lobe specimen show the neoplastic cells to be negative for. both CK7 and CK20. The cells are negative for CDX-2 and TTF1. The. cells are strongly positive for p63. This staining pattern would. support this being a squamous carcinoma that is very poorly. differentiated. The immunohistochemical control slides stain. appropriately. Final Diagnosis. Right lung lower lobe wedge biopsy #1 with frozen section: Negative for carcinoma.

3874,TCGA-78-7537.0bb9490c-1fb1-4d36-85a4-435565e9db53,"HISTORY. Tissue taken at lobectomy. MACROSCOPIC. Two specimens received. 1: The specimen is labelled ""right upper lobe"" and consists of a right upper lobectomy which measures. 140 X 120 x 50 mm in maximum dimension. On palpation there is a firm to hard mass located in the. apical segment, predominantly on the posteromedial aspect. The mass measures approximately 60 X 65. X 40 mm in maximum dimension. There is puckering of the overlying pleural surface at the apex. The. pleural surface on the medial aspect of the specimen has a fibrinous-type exudate. On sectioning there. is a solid lobulated tumour which has a yellow greyish-white cut surface. It, in places, has a villous-. like architecture. There is haemorrhage scattered throughout the tumour. The tumour appears to abut. the pleural surface. The tumour appears to lie at least 20 mm from the bronchial resection margin. There is a soft tissue resection margin which has a row of staples and measures 85 mm in length. The. tumour is well clear of this. The surrounding adjacent uninvolved lung parenchyma has a collapsed. appearance. [1A, bronchial resection margin; 1B-F, tumour; 1G, adjacent uninvolved lung. parenchyma; 1H, hilar lymph nodes]. 2: The specimen is labelled ""hilar lymph node"" and consists of four irregular greyish-black pieces of. tissue which measure in aggregate 30 x 20 X 10 mm. [BIT, 2A]. MICROSCOPIC. 1: Sections show a well differentiated adenocarcinoma. The tumour has a prominent. bronchioloalveolar component with a marked papillary pattern. The cells are tall and columnar with. variable cytoplasm ranging from non-mucinous to clear to mucinous. The lesion is subpleural but. definite pleural invasion is not identified. There is no blood vessel invasion and no lymphatic. permeation is seen. No perineural permeation is identified. The lesion is well clear of the bronchial. resection margin. Tumour appears to be present at a diathermied margin, possibly related to pleura in. block 1F. It is difficult to know whether this represents a true margin. No lymph node metastases are. present. The adjacent lung shows evidence of emphysema. Within the random section of lung, there. is. a localised area of necrosis with surrounding fibrosis. Special stains for microorganisms will be. performed. 2: Sections of the lymph nodes show reactive changes only. There is no evidence of malignancy. SUMMARY. Right upper lobe lung and hilar lymph nodes: 1: Well differentiated adenocarcinoma; 65 mm in maximal dimension. 2: No blood vessel, lymphatic or perineural invasion present. 3: No pleural invasion identified; clear of bronchial margin but extends to an area of diathermy (see. report). 4: No lymph node metastases. 5: T2N0MX. 6: Emphysema and necrotic lesion; special stains for microorganisms being performed.

All requisitions and specimen containers are labelled with the patient's name. The cassettes and AP identifiers are labelled with the Surgical Number. A. The specimen consists of a liver biopsy which measures 1.0 X 0.5 X 0.5 cm. All tissue is submitted for QS in one. block. B. The specimen consists of an unopened gallbladder measuring 9.5 cm in length and up to 2.5 cm in transverse. diameter. The outer surface is unremarkable. Sectioning reveals pale green mucoid contents containing small flecks of. yellow calculous debris measuring up to 0.2 cm in size. The mucosa is smooth and velvety. A cystic duct lymph node,. 1.2. cm. in. greatest dimension, is present at the neck of the gallbladder. Representative sections of the neck, body and. fundus are submitted in B1. The cystic duct lymph node is submitted in B2. C. The specimen consists of three fragments of tissue measuring 3.7 cm, 3.0 cm, and 0.9 cm in greatest dimension. respectively. The largest fragment appears to consist of adipose tissue only and no lymph node is recognizable. Two. representative sections are submitted in C1. The second largest fragment consists entirely of a firm yellow lymph node-. like sample. Two sections are submitted in C2 and C3. The smallest fragment is submitted in C4 in its entirety. D. The specimen consists of a pancreaticoduodenectomy specimen in which the distal stomach to distal duodenal. resection margin distance is 23.0 cm. The attached head of pancreas measures approximately 8.0 X 5.0 x 6.0 cm. A. region of the ampulla is distorted by what appears to be a zone of ulceration into an underlying mass in the head of the. pancreas. The distal common bile duct opens at this area and appears to be up to 1.3 cm in diameter. The duodenal wall. around this area appears congested and indurated. Sectioning of the head of the pancreas shows a hard tumor mass. surrounding the common bile duct and measuring 4.5 X 3,5 X approximately 4.0 cm. The carcinoma lies close to the. uncinate process but also appears to encroach on the posterior surgical margin adjacent to the duodenum; this latter area. is painted orange. The uncinate process margin is painted blue. Sections are taken as follows: Pathology: Provider, - Permanent. PHN: ACB: Surqical Pathology Report. Collected Date: D1 - proximal bile duct margin.

D19 through D21 - 11 possible lymph nodes at the inferior aspect of the head of pancreas. Frozen Section Diagnosis. A, Liver Biopsy: Bile duct hamartoma. Negative for malignancy. Microscopic Description. A: Sections after routine processing confirm the frozen section diagnosis. A small cluster of bile ducts form a localized. nodule with no cytologic atypia. B: Sections show mild chronic cholecystitis, but no cytologic atypia. The cystic duct lymph node is congested, but no sign. of malignancy is present. C: Fragments of adipose tissue include small nerve trunks. The large lymph node-like fragment is comprised of lymph. nodes showing focal lipogranulomatosis. No sign of metastatic disease is present. D: The head of pancreas is largely replaced by an invasive moderately differentiated pancreatic duct carcinoma. The. tumor shows varying growth patterns ranging from well defined glandular spaces through to irregular tongues and islands. of carcinoma with prominent nuclear pleomorphism. Many areas show clear cytoplasm consistent with mucinous. differentiation. The carcinoma invades to the zone of the ampulla where the surface of the bile duct is large eroded and. Chart Request IC.

Carcinoma focally extends to the uncinate process margin, but does not directly involve the posterior. soft tissue margin. Carcinoma focally extends beyond the confines of the pancreas into peripancreatic adipose tissue. Adjacent pancreatic parenchyma shows prominent inflammation and fibrosis. The en face section of the neck of the. pancreas is negative as is the proximal bile duct margin. Eight lymph nodes are incorporated in the sections of pancreas,. one of which shows metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. There are 16 lymph nodes dissected from the peripancreatic. fatty tissue with metastatic duct carcinoma in two, one of which is in the pancreatico-duodena zone and one in a lymph. node along inferior margin.

(baseline) / Tumor DNA pairs using 3 markers at both 1p and 19q. The 3 markers. on 1p are D1S548, D1S1592, and D1S552 (with D1S468, D1S1612, and D1S496 as. backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and PLA2G4C. (with D19S606 and D19S1182 as backup) All markers are nicrosatellites (2 or 4. nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat). polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score,. amplicon size, and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used if the. first line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or otherwise. ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each. chromosomal arm represents the typical finding in oligodendrogliomas with 1p. and 19q deletion.

PART 5: OMENTUM, EXCISION -. POSITIVE FOR ADENOCARCINOMA. COMMENT: The carcinoma extensively involves the colonic wall, from the mucosa to the pericolic adipose tissue, but no definite. precursor lesion is seen in the colonic mucosa. There is extensive, plaque-like extramural/subserosal involvement as. well, with areas of serosal penetration and at least one focus where cauterized carcinoma is present at what appears to. be the radial and/or mesocolic specimen edge. This corresponds to the operative report describing dense tumor. infiltrating the pelvic sidewall over the iliac vessels, through which the surgeon cut. In addition, immunohistochemical. stains reveal the carcinoma to be strongly positive for cytokeratin 7 with only focal positivity for cytokeratin 20. CDX-2. is. completely negative, as are TTF-1 and PSA. CEA and cytokeratin 19 are positive. Positive immunostains for the DNA. mismatch repair proteins MLH-1, PMS-2, MSH-2 and MSH-6 reveal preserved nuclear expression. In summary, the overall. morphological findings and immunohistochemical profile are not typical of a primary colorectal adenocarcinoma. A. possible primary site compatible with the immunomorphological findings is the pancreaticobiliary system. Alternatively,. if another potential primary site cannot be found clinically, this could be a primary peritoneal adenocarcinoma with. extension into the colonic wall. Finally, the lymph node total includes one lymph node confirmed to be negative for. carcinoma by a negative cytokeratin AE1/AE3 immunostain.",val,

Grade of tumor: high grade, delineated as follows: papillary architecture 2 points, nuclear pleomorphism. 2 points, mitoses 3 points for a sum of 8 points = high grade. Site of tumor: Left ovary, (also right fallopian tube, endometrial polyp, superior cervix, perirectal soft. tissue, omentum). Location of tumor: intracystic and surface of ovary. Condition of capsule: not encapsulated. Cut surface: solid and cystic. Necrosis: moderate. Lymphatic/vascular invasion: not identified. Sites of metastasis in pelvis: Left fallopian tube, cervix, endometrial polyp (see comments below);. diameter of largest pelvic metastasis = 1.7 cm, right fallopian tube. Pelvic lymph nodes: None sampled. Sites of metastasis in abdomen: omentum and peri-rectal soft tissue; maximum diameter of largest. abdominal metastasis = 14 cm, omentum. Para-aortic lymph nodes: None sampled. Peritoneal cytology: positive, metastatic papillary adenocarcinoma;. )ther abnormalities: endometrial polyp, adenomyosis. FIGO stage: IIIC. TNM stage: pT3c Nx MO. Additional comments: We favor this to be a primary serous carcinoma of the left ovary with peritoneal. spread to the right adnexa, and intracavitary spread to the endometrial polyp and superior cervix. The. possibility of a primary uterine carcinoma with spread to the ovary seems unlikely given the extensive. involvement of the left ovary with tumor. Multiple synchronous primary serous carcinomas cannot be. excluded yet also seems less likely. has reviewed the slides and concurs. Speciment (s) Received. A:Left Ovary. B:Right Ovary. C:Omentum.

Clinical History. The patient is a. with a history of severe glandular atypia on prior endocervical. curettage. who undergoes total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral. salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, biopsy of colonic implant and appendectomy. Gross Description. The specimen is received in seven parts, each labeled with the patient's name and unit number. Part A, labeled ""left ovary"", consists of a grossly distorted ovary weighing 243 grams and measuring 10 X. 7. x 9 cm. There are multiple papillated masses on the surface. A portion of fallopian tube is identified which. measures 6 cm in length and 1 cm in greatest diameter. Serial sectioning reveals that the nearly the. entire. ovarian mass consists of tan-pink, soft, friable, papillary structure. Cassette A1 contains a frozen section. remnant. Representative sections of the mass are submitted in cassettes A2-A6. Part B, labeled ""right ovary"", consists of an ovary with a portion of fallopian tube weighing 83. 5 grams. and. measuring 7 x 6 x 4.8 cm. The fallopian tube measures 7 cm in length and 2 cm in greatest diameter at. the. portion of hydrosalpinx. A large cyst is associated with the ovary measuring 6.5 cm in greatest diameter. and containing clear serous fluid. The external surfaces are inked in black. The internal surface of the cyst. cavity is smooth. A 1.3 cm nodular area beneath the cyst wall is visible in the region of the adherence of. the. fimbriae to the ovary. Sections through this region reveals a mass which is contiguous with the internal. surface of the fallopian tube obstructing the distal orifice. This mass measures 1.7 cm in greatest. diameter. A section of this area is submitted in cassette B1. Two irregularly-shaped white fibrous-appearing areas. are. also beneath the internal cyst wall; each measuring <1.5 cm in greatest diameter. Representative sections. f this fibrous area as well as a section of normal-appearing fallopian tube are submitted in cassette B2,. art C, labeled ""omentum"", consists of a section of yellow, fatty omental tissue measuring 30 X 15 X 4 cm. The central portion if firm and indurated, with a tan-white mass, which in some regions has a papillated. border. This central area of caking measures 14 cm in greatest diameter. Representative sections are. submitted in cassettes C1-C3. Part D, labeled ""uterus"", consists of a 113 gram, pink-tan uterus which measures 9.5 cm superior to. inferior, 6 cm laterally, and 4.5 cm in anterior posterior dimension. The cervical os measures 1 cm and is. fish mouth. The cut surfaces are inked in black. The endometrial surface is smooth, yellow-tan and focally. hemorrhagic. Two polyps emanate from the anterior left endometrium; one measuring 2.5 cm in greatest. diameter. Small cystic spaces are present within the myometrium which measures 2 cm in greatest. dimension. The spaces measure0.2 cm in greatest dimension. Representative sections are submitted as. follows: Cassette D1: Anterior cervix,. Cassette D2: Posterior cervix.

The tumor is located in the right. anterior, mid anterior, left anterior, left anterolateral, left lateral, left posterolateral, left posterior, mid. posterior, right posterior, right posterolateral and right lateral peripheral zone. It is estimated that the tumor. occupies approximately 70% of the prostatic volume. The tumor focus measures 4.5 X 3.0 cm in the largest. cross-sectional dimension and it is present in three cross sections and extensively in the apex and base. regions. The tumor exhibits extraprostatic extension in the left lateral and left posterolateral aspect of the. prostate, left superior neurovascular bundle region and posterior surface of the prostate at the base level. At the sites of extraprostatic extension, the margin of resection is free of tumor. The tumor extends in the. right posterolateral aspect of the prostate to less than 0.1 mm from the inked surface. Focal marginal. involvement cannot be excluded. The tumor extensively involves the left seminal vesicle including intra and extraprostatic portions. Please refer to the previous report for the diagnosis of the pelvic lymph nodes. GROSS DESCRIPTION. Page: 4.

Gross Description. The specimen is received fresh in one part, labeled with the patient's name, unit number and ""prostate. + seminal vesicles fresh,"" and consists of a 36 gm prostate gland with attached seminal vesicle/vas. deferens bundles. The gland measures 3.5 cm from medial-lateral, 3 cm from apex-base, and 3 cm. from anterior-posterior. The exterior of the gland is smooth with a staple line along the anterior. midline, with a red-tan exterior. The seminal vesicle/vas deferens bundles are soft and red-tan. The. left measures 3.5 x 1.5 x 1 cm and the right measures 2.5 x 2 x 1 cm. The right vas deferens measures. 2.5 x 0.5 cm and the left measures 4 x 0.5 cm. A firm mass is palpated along the right posterior. lateral. The right anterior surface of the gland is inked in green, the left anterior surface is inked in. blue, and the posterior surface is inked in black. The apical and bladder margins are removed, and the. remainder of the gland is serially sectioned from apex to base into six slices of 4 mm average thickness. The seminal vesicle/vas deferens bundles are attached to serial slice 6. The serial slices reveal a 0.5. cm area of firm yellow tissue on the right lateral of slice 2. No other lesions are grossly identified. Following further dissection and submission of tissue for possible research evaluation, representative. sections from slices 1-3 are taken for research purposes.

SPECIMEN DESCRIPTION. 1 vial of FFPE sections for IDH sequencing. Neuropathology Report. IDH1 and IDH2 MUTATION STATUS. HISTOLOGICAL ASSESMENT: The sample was review by a pathologist and estimated to contain at least 50 % tumour cells. METHOD: Codon 132 of the IDIII gene and codon 172 of the IDII2 gene are amplified and sequenced by pyrosequencing. IDHI: No Mutation Detected. IDH2: MUTATIONDETECTED - R172M. The HGVS nomenclature for this mutation is NM_002168.2(IDI(2): c.515G>T (p.R172M). COMMENTS. This result indicates that the tumour harbours the IDH2(p.R172M) mutation. No IDHI codon 132 mutation was present. Note: All PCR based tests are subject to a low risk of non-amplification of one allele due to primer binding site. single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). This can lead to a false negative result. Sample fixation causes DNA degradation which may result in false negative results due to non-amplification of. one allele (allelic drop out) or false positive results due to trans-lesional nucleotide repair during PCR. amplification. SUMMARY. This result indicates that the tumour harbours the IDH2 (p.R172M) mutation.",test,

At one point and. in a larger lymph node only very small areas occupied by tumor cell nests. EVALUATION. Primary diagnosis/diagnoses: Central bronchopulmonary, histologically largely undifferentiated, large-cell squamous cell carcinoma of the. right lower lobe of the lung (C4) with overgrowth of the interlobar fissure and continuous growth into the. adjacent section of the middle lobe and also several in some cases large lymph node metastases. Tumor. classification according to this picture pT2 pN3 L1 V1 R1, stage III. C34.3 M8070/3. Secondary diagnosis/diagnoses: Peripheral bronchiolectasia in the lower lobe, relatively large fibrous cicatricial remodeling zone in S10. mediobasal and similar flat subpleural cicatricial zones in S1 apical. Local high-grade pleural fibrosis over S10. Tumor-associated inflammation and small tumor necroses. Slight anthracotic pigment deposits in the lung. parenchyma and relatively marked in some lymph nodes. Remark/addendum: The main mass of the carcínoma lies in S10. Centrally it has grown as far as the bifurcations of the lower lobe. main bronchus and the middle lobe bronchus, without these being destroyed or constricted. The tumor invasion. of small blood vessels only concerns the focal region, the lymphangioinvasion is more marked and is also. located in the vicinity of the tumor focus. The R1 classification is based on the finding that carcinoma nests in. the large involved lymph nodes next to the bifurcation of the upper lobe bronchus extend to the mediastinal. resection plane. Further lymph node metastases are seen at the intermediate bronchus in the mediastinum and. also in the lymph nodes located under 4.) - 6.). The pN3 classification is also made with regard to the previous. finding with carcinoma cell structures in the fine needle aspiration biopsy from LN4 left (according to clinical. data).",test,

Sections show an encapsulated tumor composed predominantly of nodular. proliferations of small lymphocytes admixed with lesser numbers of bland. epithelioid cells (90-95% of the tumor). separated by fibrous septae. These are admixed with scattered areas composed of bland spindle cells. containing few lymphocytes (5-10% of the tumor) The tumor appears to be. completely encapsulated, but a single focus of microscopic transcapsular. invasion is identified (block 1H) However, the tumor appears to be. covered with ample adipose tissue at this point (approx. 0.8 cm from the. tumor to the painted surface) An area overlying the tumor marked with a. stitch shows a resolving hematoma with surrounding foreign body giant. cell response and dense fibrosis, consistent with the previous open. biopsy site. The tumor appears encapsulated in this area, with tumor. cells 0.6 cm from the cauterized margin of this site. [mmunohistochemical staining confirming thymic derivation were previously. performed. and were not repeated here. The overall findings. remain of a WHO type AB thymoma, with focal microscopic transcapsular. invasion (modified Masaoka stage IIa). GROSS DESCRIPTION. 1.

""Right breast mass #1"", received fresh labeled with the patient's name and. record number for frozen section is a 4 x 2.9 x 2.2 cm specimen with a 2 x 2 x. 1.3 cm tumor. The frozen section remnant is submitted in A1. A2-A4 represent. full cross sections of the tumor and adjacent tissue. B. ""Right breast, long lateral short superior"", received fresh is a right. mastectomy specimen weighing 2040 grams. The skin ellipse measures 34.5 x. 17.5 cm, has a 4 cm areola and a 0.9 cm nipple. A suture marks the lateral. aspect of the specimen. The breast measures 35 x 23 x 6 cm with an 8 x 6.5 x. 1 cm axillary tail. In the upper outer quadrant is a recent sutured surgical. incision 7 cm. The soft tissue margins are inked blue. Sectioning shows a. recent biopsy cavity approximately 5 cm in diameter deep to the suture. On. the medial aspect of this biopsy cavity, another tumor is identified. While. contiguous with the cavity, the bulk of the tumor is more medial. This is felt. to represent a single ""dumbell"" shaped tumor rather than two separate tumors. Maximal dimensions of this tumor are 5 x 3.5 x 3 cm. This tumor is also. located in the upper lateral quadrant and is 2 cm from the deep resection. margin. Further firm tissue suspicious for tumor is identified in the lateral. aspect of the biopsy cavity and measures 2 cm. Again this is 2 cm from the. deep resection margin.

TUMOR EXTENDING TO THE MARGIN OF RESECTION. PROSTATIC INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA (PIN), HIGH GRADE. Right and left seminal vesicles, no tumor present. Segments of right and left vasa deferentia, no tumor present. COMMENT. The prostate gland contains three foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma, one in the transition zone and two in the peripheral zone. The. dominant tumor focus and the one of the highest histologic grade is located in the right and left transition zone. This tumor focus. measures 3.0 x 1.5 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension, and it is present in four cross sections and extensively in the. apical region. This tumor focus exhibits predominately Gleason grades 4 and 3. A minor (tertiary) component of Gleason grade 5. is. also. present. This tumor exhibits focal extraprostatic extension (less than 1.0 mm) in the right anterior surface of the prostate. and. extends. to the margin of resection in the anterior apical region. The extent of marginal involvement is 6.0 mm. The two. peripheral zone foci are located in the left posterolateral and right lateral peripheral zone. The tumor located in the left. posterolateral. peripheral zone measures 0.8 x 0.4 cm in the largest cross-sectional dimension, and it is present in the first cross. section of the prostate. The third tumor focus is located in the right lateral peripheral zone. This tumor measures 0.5 x 0.2 cm in. the. largest cross-sectional dimension, and it is present in one cross section. The non-dominant tumor foci are of lower histologic. grade (Gleason score 6/3 + 3) and are confined to the prostate with negative margins. GROSS DESCRIPTION. (A). PROSTATE AND SEMINAL VESICLES - A specimen consisting of a prostate, attached right and left seminal vesicles and. attached segments of right and left vasa deferentia. The. prostate gland (2.5 x 2.2 x 4.0 cm, 31 grams, post fixation) has the usual shape. The soft tissue present along the. right and left posterolateral aspects of the prostate appears symmetrical. A palpable and visible nodule is observed in the left mid. region of the prostate. Serial cross sections after fixation demonstrate firm areas consistent with tumor in the right transition zone. and right peripheral zone of the first three of the four cross sections of the prostate. The seminal vesicles and segments of vasa deferentia are grossly free of tumor.
